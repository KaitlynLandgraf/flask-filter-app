## a look at Bay Area curbside resiential garbage pickup fees

Over the past few months, I've made public records requests for every city in the Bay Area that contracts with either Recology or Waste Management--the two biggest solid waste management companies in the reigon. I asked for data from 2006 and 2016 to compare how prices have risen over the past decade, and I've created a datafile with the info. 

Even the data file is relatively small, I'd like to make an app that allows the user to search 1) by company (Recology v. Waste Management), or 2) by their city (I have data from cities as far north as Vallejo and as far south/east as Cupertino)

The details page would show two things: how much rates have risen in that city over the past year, and what the current price for a 32-gallon waste bucket would be

# Some data applications that inspire me:

- the Surgeon Scorecard (https://projects.propublica.org/surgeons/)
- Cal Access (by netfile, not the gov's one) (https://cal-access.com/#/)
- SF OpenData portal (https://data.sfgov.org/)
